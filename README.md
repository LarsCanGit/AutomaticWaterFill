# AutomaticWaterFill
Mod for Farming Simulator 22

The AutomaticWaterFill mod will automatically fill all animal pens that require water every 4 hours, and the cost
of the water is docked from your bank balance. 

The frequency is set to every 4 hours, as some large pens may need multiple refills in a day due to the amount
of animals. This value can be edited in the .lua file, just unzip the file, edit the .lua file in any text editor
and re-create the zip file and drop back into the mods folder.
